Welcome to the Blackjack game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, written in Python.

## How to Play üéÆ

1. The game starts with the user being asked if they want to play a game of Blackjack.
2. Each player (the user and the computer) is dealt two cards initially.
3. The user can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
4. The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over. A hand value of 21 with two cards is called "Blackjack".
5. The computer will also play by drawing cards until it reaches a score of at least 17.
6. The game will determine the winner based on the final hand values.
